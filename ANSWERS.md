1 ) You can use PropTypes to make sure the correct data type is being passed down to a component. Checking type avoids errors where a user might input the wrong     type of data and cause the app to break.

2 ) A lifecycle event in react is compromised of three portions or 'phases' : Mounting, updating, and unmounting. 

3 ) A higher order component is one that receives another component therefore being able to modify it which makes them more dynamic.

4 ) The three ways to aply styling to components are vanilla CSS, styled-components, and through the use of ReacStrap.
    Vanilla CSS grants the most maliability but is also the most time consuming of the three.
    Styled-components can be used to wrap previous styled components into new ones, which may save time.
    ReacStrap are premade components which are the fastest but not easy to modify.
